# Guide to Using Wix - For Students

## What is Wix?

Wix provides cloud-based web development services. It offers tools for creating HTML5 websites and mobile sites using online drag-and-drop editing.

## Why Wix?

Allows you to build websites using GUI based tools.  We will focus here on using Wix to build and manage your eportfolio.  Since you will be the owner of your site and it's content, you can continue to edit this site as you build yourself as a student and working professional to display your skills, experiences, and resume.

## Getting Started

1. [Create a Wix Account](https://users.wix.com/signin/signup/password?view=sign-up&sendEmail=true&loginCompName=SignUp_H&referralInfo=SignUp_H&postSignUp=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wix.com%2Fnew%2Fintro%2F&postLogin=https%3A%2F%2Fmanage.wix.com%2Faccount%2Froute&loginDialogContext=signup&originUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wix.com%2Fwebsite%2Ftemplates%2Fhtml%2Fportfolio-cv&forceRender=true)
   - Note: Since you will own this, you can use either your wright.edu account or a personal email account
   - When creating your account, you will be prompted to have an AI ask you profile questions to assist with site content.  This is optional.
2. [Pick a CV template to get started](https://www.wix.com/website/templates/html/portfolio-cv), hover over it, and select "Edit"
3. You will be moved to an editing window, which will start by prompting you for details to allow AI to assist with filling out site content
